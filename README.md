# ToonTanks
It is a game I developed with Unreal Engine written in C++ and Blueprint, in which I implemented 3 pawns, the tank used by the player, 
the enemy turrets and the enemy tank, the goal is to destroy all the enemies without dying, all the pawns can fire projectiles and the 
enemy tank automatically follows the tank controlled by the player and when it enters in the range of the enemy it is attacked by the 
projectiles, I have also implemented sound effects and visual effects when the projectile is fired and when it hits, in addition I have 
created 3 Widgets one for the start of the game and 2 in case of victory or defeat.
